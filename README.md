With this program we have the goal to solve doubts of whoever use it, music fashionate or not, when he is talking about bands and guitarists. Infact, with our program, you have the possibility to know if a guitarist you know is part of a band and of which one exactly, or the other way round you can tell us a band name and we will tell you who is the guitarist who plays in it. 

#How? 
You just have to run our program and when is displayed the writing: 
"Tell us a guitarist name or a band name: "
Then it will be displayed your answer depending on your request.

#Now let's give you a bit instruction on how use it
It's nothing much complicated. We have to say to you that there are couple of things that you have to keep in mind. You have to write the names with capital letter for any you wrote.
So for example if you write name and surname of a guitarist 'Jimmy Page' you have to write both with capital letter. Otherwise the system will produce an error
